# AWS Cloud WAN Module

This module can be used to deploy an [AWS Cloud WAN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/cloudwan/what-is-cloudwan.html) Core Network using the [Terraform AWS Cloud Control Provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-awscc). A Core Network is built inside a Global Network, so if that resources is not provided, it is also created.

## Usage

The example below builds a Network Manager Global Network and a Cloud WAN Core Network from scratch. The Core Network needs the ID of the Global Network created, and also a policy document (to define the global infrastructure). An example of a policy document can be found [here](./examples/without_globalnetwork/locals.tf).

```hcl
module "cloudwan" {
  source = "../.."

  global_network = {
    description = "Global Network - AWS CloudWAN Module"
  }
  core_network = {
    description            = "Core Network - AWS CloudWAN Module"
    policy_document        = local.policy
  }

  tags = {
      Name = "cloudwan-module-without"
  }
}
```

If you already have a Network Manager Global Network created, you can pass the ID as variable and only create the Cloud Wan Core Network.

```hcl
module "cloudwan" {
  source = "../.."

  global_network = {
    id = aws_networkmanager_global_network.global_network.id
  }
  core_network = {
    description            = "Global Network - AWS CloudWAN Module"
    policy_document        = local.policy
  }

  tags = {
      Name = "cloudwan-module-with"
  }
}
```
