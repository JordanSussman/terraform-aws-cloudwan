# AWS Cloud WAN Module - Example with a Network Manager Global Network created

This example creates a Cloud WAN Core Network from scratch, using the Terraform AWS Cloud Control Provider. It supposes that a Network Manager Global Network is already created (using the Terraform AWS Provider), so it takes the ID as parameter.

## Usage

- Initialize Terraform using `terraform init`.
- As the Global Network should be created beforehand, first you need to deploy that resource first: `terraform apply -target=aws_networkmanager_global_network.global_network`
- Now you can deploy the rest of the infrastructure using `terraform apply`.
- To delete everything, use `terraform destroy`.
