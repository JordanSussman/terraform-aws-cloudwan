# AWS Cloud WAN Module - Example with a Network Manager Global Network created

This example creates a Cloud WAN Core Network from scratch. It supposes that a Network Manager Global Network is already created, so it takes the ID as parameter.

## Usage

- Initialize Terraform using `terraform init`.
- Now you can deploy the rest of the infrastructure using `terraform apply`.
- To delete everything, use `terraform destroy`.
