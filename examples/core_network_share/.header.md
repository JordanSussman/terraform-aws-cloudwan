# AWS Cloud WAN Module - Sharing Core Network

This example creates an AWS Network Manager Global Network and Core Network from scratch, sharing the Core Network with the AWS Account provided in the `aws_account_share` - we recommend the use of a *terraform.tfvars* file to indicate the AWS Account in your testing environment.

**Remember that if you are using the AWS Cloud WAN to share the Core Network, you need to create the resources in us-east-1 (North Virginia)**

## Usage

- Initialize Terraform using `terraform init`.
- Now you can deploy the rest of the infrastructure using `terraform apply`.
- To delete everything, use `terraform destroy`.
